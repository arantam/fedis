python GUI client for redis

there is a story here:
once at a deep night, i felt quite excited and not willing to go to bed(because of the tea), 
so i wrote this GUI tool with Python.
actually, this tool based upon another tool that i made last year, which was used for reverse-engineering(mysql table->java model with JPA annotation).
before now, i did it with python2.7, but now with python3.4.2, cool stuff.
My name is Farago, so i name this tool 'f + edis'.
it runs fine currently, hope you like it. but there are still some un-solved problems to be fired.
i'll work it out some day in the future, you know.
